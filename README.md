# Enhanced Handwritten Character Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks | github Jan 2023
* The project focused on tackling a challenging character recognition problem using higher-resolution grayscale images of
handwritten letters.
* We used two datasets, EMNIST (Extended MNIST) Letters and Binary AlphaDigits, to train and evaluate various neural
network architectures.
* Skills : Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Python Programming, TensorFlow and Keras, PyTorch,
Data Preprocessing, Model Optimization, Hyperparameter, Tuning, TensorBoard, Transfer Learning, Image Processing
